# Game Play Summary
## Playability - Clarity, Flow, Balance, Length, Intgration and Fun
Overall I would say that theis game rates well with the clarity and flow criteria. In my opinion this ame hit the 'Goldilocks Zone' between too much information and and too little presented to the player.  Althou the premise rquired a suspension of disbelief and the laws of physics it maintained consitency with in its own 'game' universe nd player never felt 'jaarred' out of the game.  For an intermediate gameer (not me) this game provide a good balance and progression of difficulties.  I found some of the puzzels frustrating as I knew the 'solution' but could not execute them, a player withmore experiece would not have this difficulty.  I found it mildly enjoyable and I may paly it again to see if my ability improves.
### Test environment:  I tested this Single user game on a Windows OS 64 bit PC computer after down loading the EXE and datafiles required to run the game.
### Controls
Due to lack of gaming experience I hade a little trouble figurinng out soem of the controls.  I found the help and settings panels easy to access and very well laid out in the contxt of the game.  I never did get the technique for doing a double jump with my system.  Some tiem I found a descrepensy in the responsiveness of the game to player input nothing very bad just some times it seemed to respond to my input faster at certain times.
### Camera
For the most part I found the camera work fairly good except that some angle allowed me to look through the player, while interesting to see the inside of her arm I would classify it as a bug.
### Character
I liked the character most the animations seem 'correct', however I found her forward walk and walk backwards wrong as it appeared her feed moved sidways while teh motion went forward or bakc ward.  I did grow to 'like' her as the game progressed.  Several times it appeared the character could stand on air if she got very close to the edge of a platform.

# Bugs
I concider the fact that the camera can 'look through' the player's avatar from below throu the top of her head, or through her back iff to close a minor bug, I got used to it after playing the game for a while.
I also believe they should have paid more attention to the animation of teh character especially th waling forward or backward, the run and jump animations seemd correct to me.
# Final Thoughts
I think Time Glitch represents a well executed game of an intreaging original concept.  A platformer game where the player usees a multipurpose 'time gun' to manipulate time to solve problems.  I liked the interface as I found consistent, clear and functional, with the ability modify all settings I would use.  I found a few minor 'bugs' the camera and animations noted earlier.  I found I started to like the character even if I dould not get her to double jump correctly.
