# Game Play Summary
## Playability - Clarity, Flow, Balance, Length, Integration and Fun
Overall I would say that this game rates well with the clarity and flow criteria. In my opinion this game hit the 'Goldilocks Zone' between too much information and and too little presented to the player.  Although the premise requires a suspension of disbelief and the laws of physics it maintained consistency with in its own 'game' universe and player never felt 'jarred' out of the game.  For an intermediate gamer (not me) this game provide a good balance and progression of difficulties.  I found some of the puzzles frustrating as I knew the 'solution' but could not execute them, a player with more experience would not have this difficulty.  I found it mildly enjoyable and I may play it again to see if my ability improves.
### Test environment
I tested this Single user game on a Windows OS 64 bit PC computer after down loading the EXE and data files required to run the game.  It had a very smooth installation and game startup
### Controls
Due to lack of gaming experience I had a little trouble figuring out some of the controls.  I found the help and settings panels easy to access and very well laid out in the context of the game.  I never did get the technique for doing a double jump consistently with my system.  Some times I found a discrepancy in the responsiveness of the game to player input nothing very bad just some times it seemed to respond to my input faster at certain times.
### Camera
For the most part I found the camera work fairly good except that some angle allowed me to look through the player, while interesting to see the inside of her arm I would classify it as a bug.
### Character
I liked the character most the animations seem 'correct', however I found her forward walk and walk backwards wrong as it appeared her feed moved sideways while the motion went forward or backward.  I did grow to 'like' her as the game progressed.  Several times it appeared the character could stand on air if she got very close to the edge of a platform.

# Bugs
I consider the fact that the camera can 'look through' the player's avatar from below through the top of her head, or through her back iff to close a minor bug, I got used to it after playing the game for a while.
I also believe they should have paid more attention to the animation of the character especially the waling forward or backward, the run and jump animations seemed correct to me.
# Final Thoughts
I think Time Glitch represents a well executed game of an intriguing original concept.  A plat-former game where the player uses a multipurpose 'time gun' to manipulate time to solve problems.  I liked the interface as I found consistent, clear and functional, with the ability modify all settings I would use.  I found a few minor 'bugs' the camera and animations noted earlier.  I found I started to like the character even if I could not get her to double jump correctly.
