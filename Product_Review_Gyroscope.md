### Review of Gyroscope
Gyroscope represents a game testing tool that not only tests the interface of your game from a player stand point in the game but uses AI learning to play it as a more advanced gamer would as they learn the game.
* This product has 5 main features:
  1.  The AI can learn about individual players and taylor its action recommendations to the indivual playr and this 'tayloring' evolves during game plays, the AI get better.
  2.  This product got written in C# and uses standard interfaces to send commands (game action triggers) to the game.
      * Game controller inputs
      * Ads (boo hiss)
      * In-App purchases
      * Random number generators
      * Enemy difficulty calibration
      * Boss encounter frequency
  3.  Installs in Unity as a standard asseet that you to list your actions (Test case steps)
  4.  Collects all event data required
  5.  Executes experiemnts behind the scenes and acts on wht it learns (adaptive or learning AI)
  6.  Tracks game Key Perfomance Indicators
  
  Used in conjuction with a browser automation tool like Selenium-WebDriver developers have a way to test their game on mutliple devices and platforms and tie the results back to specific test cases and bug reports.
  I think one of the most important parts of this testing software exists in the proprietary AI code. or as developer calls it an 'algorithm of algorithms'.  The devlopers can define an “observation space” the information the AI can understand.  By defining the “observation space” devlopers can test for specific action and see how the player reacts to the actions and rewords or if enough time exists let the AI determine the “observation space”.  If the AI created “observation space” differs from the expected “observation space” then an analysis as to why needs to get performed.
  Because this software can perfom thousands of test in a cloud environemnt such as "Google Cloud Platform" and automated data collection of events from the AI, only data analysis tools provide a practiple method of analyzing the results of the test.
