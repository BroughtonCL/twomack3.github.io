# Synopsis
The player has the goal of moving the bug, a lady bug icon from its present position to the flashing red dot.  The player uses swipes of taps on translucent arros to move the bug.
# Game Play Summary
This game has three modes: single player (tested), multi-player (unable to test), and 'Dark Mode' (unable to unlock, therefore not tested).
The player gets presented with a maze with the bug icon at the start and a flashing red dot the represents the end and by using a series of swipes and taps the player moves the bug to the end.
The player can move the bug bone of two ways, either swiping in the direction to move the bug (finger selected) or tap on translucent arrows to move the bug (select arrows).  The bug starts in the directon swiped or chosen and goes to it reaches a deadend or decision point (junction with more than one possible moves).  The player cannot have the bug follow his finger to the end; I found this frustrating and counter-intuitive.
## Playability
I and many others (see reviews) found the over abundance of ads in this game made almost unplayable and killed all enjoyment of playing the game.  The banner ads (which I could not turn off) cover 10 to 15% of the top of the game covering infromation on the Stage Mode (your progression information), covers some of the information and artwork during game play and I found their constant scrolling and changing very distracting, especially on the more advanced mazes.
When looking for help or the player wants to change a setting the player must: select the settings screen (gear icon), see full screen ad, clear full screen ad, make changes on settings screen, return to play tapped, see full screen ad, clear full screen ad, play.  The display of full screen ads happes on ALL scene changes.
I did not have the patience to figure out how to unlock the 'Dark Mode' and the game does not say how (purchase?, level up? ...) so I never tested it.
### Single/Multiplayer
This game has a multiplayer mode which I could never get to work (I gave up after ten minutes waiting for a connection), therefore; I only tested the single player mode.  I did not find any reviews of the multiplayer mode so maybe not only I have this problem.
### Controls
By selecting the gear icon near the top right (if not covered by an ad) the player can turn off the music (highly recommended), write a review (which I did with an one star rating) or select either 'swipe' controls (finger icon) or arrow controls (right, left, up down arrow icons).  I suggest using the arrow icons as they act more like the player exptects.  As mentioned earlier, when using the swipe controls (finger) the bug does not follow your finger, but starts moving in the direction of the first swipe, moves till it reaches a deadend or decision point, where the next swipe tells the bug how to start moving.  Using the arrows removes the expectation the bug will follow your finger, the bug starts in the direction of the arrow tapped, as the player expects.

# Bugs
I consider the amount of ads and that the banner ads cover some the game as bugs, I understand the need for revenew from free games, but not to the extent they make me want to avoid all Mobirix games in the future and boycott the advertisers.
The finger/swipe mode did not always correctly register my input and move the bug correctly when at the edge of the screen.  Many times it took multiple swipes (as repeatable as I could) and several times the bug moved in the wrong direction.
# Final Thoughts
I chose this game because it met my two criteria, free with no in-app purchases and met the maze game requirement, but I would not reccommend it to anyone.  This game has the potential to provide relaxing fun and challenges to a wide range of players even with its somewhat quirky finger mode, but the overabundance and intrusiveness of the ads make it un-enjoyable and almost unplayable.
