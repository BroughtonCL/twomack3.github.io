# Test Plan for: Fireball by international hobo

## Summary Information
From the Frireball game design document (GDD): "Fireball is a budget game for PS2. The player controls a ball of fire, and traverses a landscape made of blocks of different materials. As the player sets fire to these blocks, they grow hotter, and can set fire to more and more different types of blocks. The fireball the player controls can also rise up in height and the hotter the player gets, the higher they can jump in this fashion.

On each field (level) the player has an ultimate goal of igniting the torch (brazier) and thus clearing the field – but the torch is generally positioned at a high point and out of reach. The player must use a combination of platform skills and dynamic environmental features (for instance, by burning the supports under the torch down to the ground) in order to clear the field.

Simple, clean cut graphics and controls combine to give an easy to learn but engaging play experience"

### Environment/User Community
According the GDD This game will come in two different version aimed at two different markets.  The Fireball game will target the casual gamer or impulse buyer, while the Hidama will target the hard core gamern with its unique game play.

### Test Objectives:
Test the subsystems against the GDD stated desired player experience of:
1.  Effortless play coming from a simple control scheme.
2.  Unique experience – the only game to be based around setting fires.
3.  Varied solutions to the mini-puzzles as the player works out the best places to start fires.
4.  Exploration of small environments.
Test the following subsystems:
1.  Avatar which controls the player's ability to move around the landscape
2.  Temperature which controls the the ignitions of blocks in the world abnd how the fire spreads between blocks
3.  Gravity which concerns the collapse of objects and blocks as result for the fires.

We paln to run the following test cases on each build teseted:
### Acceptance Criteria (Estimated number of defect or internal test acceptance criteria)
These tests will have an overall acceptance criteria of 70% for the Alpha build(s) and 90% for the Beta Builds
