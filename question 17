 * Description 
* Pre-Test Conditions: 
 * The tested version will come from a version compiled on a PC with the Windows 7 Operating System as well as a Mac running OSX Lion.  The tested version will use the compiler included in the Eclipse (Indigo or Juno) integrated development environment (IDE).  We guarantee will operate in the same environment as tested - the only slight difference that the end user will not have the need to compile in order to run their game - they will just need version 6 or above of the JRE (Java runtime environment) which includes the JVM (Java virtual machine) which the finalized program needs to run.
