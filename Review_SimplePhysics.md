# Information
## Game Title
SimplePhysics
## Game Type
Puzzle - building game for players 9+ or a very smart 8 year old
## Platform
This game exists on Google Play store and Apple Store, (iOS and Android operating systems)
## Game Rating
This game has a Metacritic score of 54.  I disagreed with the premise of the negative review in that I believe trial and error in a safe and fun environment provides a great learning experience (especially if they do not know they have learned something).
## Publisher
Jundroo published this game on the Apple Store and Goggle Play.
## Developer
Jundroo developed this game and a companion SimpleRockets which I also recommend.
## Publishing Date
The first version got released inDecember of 2014, I played the 2015 version and I reviewed the 2017 version for this review.
# Synopsis
This game should come with the following "Warning, You will have fun and learn something".  The player gets presented with various structural physics problems and using s simple and intuitive interface 'builds a solution'.  The player earns rewards by creating a solution the meets the stated criteria at the cheapest cost.  As the game states “An engineer is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar.”  This game teaches the basics of structural engineering in manner that 'hides' the learning process, the player just has fun.

# Game Play Summary
I suggest the player start with the tutorial and tackle the levels in order.  The player gets presented with a set of criteria the solution must meet in order to 'win' the level and a reward - costs table for the level.  For example the simplest level build a tree house has the following criteria: Three attachment points to the tree, hold 4 50lb kids (shown as test boxes) for 10 seconds.  Each beam used has cost as a function of length.  The player earns 3 stars for a solution costing less than $150.00, 2 stars for a solution costing more than $150.00 but less than $200.00 and one star for a solution costing more than $200.00 but less than $250.00.  This same play structure exists for all levels with the difficulty increasing as the level increases.  I found the puzzles ranged from simple to very challenging, especially 'Windy City'.
## Playability
### Single/Multiplayer
This game comes in single player versions only
### Controls
The controls conform to the standard iOS iPad controls, touch to select touch-slide to draw a beam, touch the hammer to change from build to remove (hammer changes to an "X" and the grid turns red)
# Bugs
I did not note any bugs while I played, however; I really missed the 'test' mode from earlier version that helped you determine the stresses on the various joints and beams.
# Final Thoughts
In the interest of full disclosure I have an engineering degree and really liked the fact this game teaches/reviews fundamental engineering concepts in a very indirect manner (the player does not realize that learning takes place while playing).  I found the user interface intuitive and simple to understand while presenting an accurate representation of what happens in testing the solution, such as the structure fails to meet the criteria within budget.  The design of the playing levels has enough interest in the back ground with out detracting from the solution of the problem.  I recommend this game as a way to sharpen your analytical skills (don't tell anyone) while having fun.
