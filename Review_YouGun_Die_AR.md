# Synopsis
You Gun Die gives the player an augmented reality arcade first person shooter game, by using your phone or iPad to look around and shoot at an endless supply of enemies till one gets you (I had a high score of 10 without any power-ups).  In app power-up purchases include bombs, auto-fire modes and extras lives.  My wife had fun watching me run, duck, dodge and weave around the house while I tried to keep alive and kill the 'purple blobs'.

# Game Play Summary
Playing this game represents the height of simplicity: tap the target reticle (circle) on the screen on the phone or iPad to fire at what exits in the circle, dodge by running away, duck and weave from the white ghosts and purple blobs.  The floating blobs and ghosts show agains what ever the camera sees (in my case my living room).  Start the game and point the camera around the room or outside and choose either: play, Power-up store (for in app purchases) or High Scores (to see how you compare to others). Tap play turn and put the target reticle on the blobs and start tapping.  An oval at the bottom of the bottom of the screen show the enemy as purple dots in relation to you and which way you must face to kill them  Dots at the bottom of the oval represent enemies behind you.  You keep tapping, running, ducking, weaving and killing enemies until they kill you.  You cannot win. Then start again because your had some fun.

The game offers a free "revival" if you send people the link and an invitation play.

## Playability
I found the game easy and fun to play, I liked the fact that you needed move around to survive and kill the blobs, I did have to watch out for for furniture, Legos and others while playing.

I did wish for a higher rate of fire for the game (how fast can you tap), however; they have an in app purchase for that.  I played on a 13" iPad pro, which while give a good view of the blobs, the size made hard to tap the firing-target circle in the center of the screen.

I found the play very smooth and the view kept up with my movements, the blobs had an accurate size and sense of distance from the player, they only appeared at a distance if the view allowed it.  If the user backs up to a wall the enemy will only appear very close behind them (not a good idea I found), but further away in front of the player.  As you kill blobs, they come at you in ever increasing numbers and will swarm you from every direction, ducking and running will put them behind you so you can kill more of them, but the get you in the end.

### Single/Multiplayer
This game only exists as a single player version at the current time.

### Controls
As mentioned above I found the controls: simple, intuitive, minimalistic and very appropriate for the game; basically an aiming device and trigger (tap the circle).  I found the controls very responsive to my inputs and movements with no hesitations or glitches, even when I performed 'evasive' maneuvers.

# Bugs
I did not find any bugs in my testing, the game played and reacted as I expected and when I expected it to.

# Final Thoughts
I tried out several AG games before deciding on this one to review and I have become a fan of AR games, mainly because they require movement from the player.  I actually worked up a sweat playing this and another game.  This game purports to do nothing more than have you use your iOS device "to look around and shoot at endless enemy invaders that are in the room with you!", which it does in a fun way even if "You Gun Die".  The smooth and seamless integration of the game with reality (camera view), with the simple and responsive controls make this game enjoyable to play.  I may even spring for some of the power-ups.
