# Game Play Summary
## Playability
Overall I found the game intriquing and an original take on the puzzel/adventure game, however; I the control (keyboard) and reactions to control input I found frustrating.  Once the game started I found it moved at a satisfying pace.  The game has a very consitent look  and feel through all the scenes, help and credit displays.

I found the camera views smooth and logical after I figured out the neuances of "switching" characters.
### Single/Multiplayer
This game only comes in a single user version.

# Bugs
I consider the following a bug while other more experienced gamers would consider it an additional challenge that rewards increased skill level:
1.  Bunny animations seemed inconsitent, the same keyboard input did not always give the same animations or movement.
2.  The bunny did not always move in the direction expected according to the instructions.
3.  Lack of explaination for the bars shown on the UI for the player
# Final Thoughts
One paragraph summary of your overall viewpoint of the game.
